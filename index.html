		<p>My name is Cassandra Henderson. I was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, but raised in a few metro cities in the state of Georgia. I have a husband who somehow found his way all the way from Minneapolis, MN to Marietta, Georgia to find the love of his life, lol. We have two beautiful daughters, 2 years old and 10 months old.

		I find peace of mind spending time with my family, writing, reading, and helping others build their entrepenurial dreams. 

	    I am excited about this class because I know this will only enhance the technical skills I have. As an entrepenur, adding website development to your tool belt not only saves you money, not having to outsource web innovations, but it provides another service offering to your clients. I look forward to this jouney as a web developer and the doors it will open for me and my clients.</p>
